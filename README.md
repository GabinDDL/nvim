# Yag000's Neovim config

This repository contains my personal config files. For an optimal experience, I recommend using my own
[dotfiles](https://github.com/Yag000/dotfiles) repository, but you can use them with any other configuration.

## Installation

For now the installation is manual and I use the lazyvim plugin manager.

## Dependencies

- _[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)_ for [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
